What are rusts comment types?
<!--question-->
Regular comments which are ignored by the compiler:
- `// Line comments which go to the end of the line.`
- `/* Block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */`

Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html):
- `/// Generate library docs for the following item.`
- `//! Generate library docs for the enclosing item.`
